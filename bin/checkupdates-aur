=head1 NAME

checkupdates-aur - checkupdates for packages installed from AUR

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Prints updates for packages installed from AUR (in checkupdates format)...

Hint: Should be useful in "ArchLinux Updates Indicator" addon for Gnome-Shell.

=head1 USAGE

To check updates:

    # checkupdates-aur

    is equal to:

    # checkupdates-aur -s pacman -a '-Qm' -F columns -f name=0 -f ver=1

    as this are default values for `-s pacman` which is default.

    note: `-s` is root argument and `-a`, `-F` and `-f` are his sub...

    `-a` - pacman argument (can be use multiple times)
    `-F` - filter name: `columns`:
        `-f` - columns counted from 0: `name=?`, `ver=?`

    For more info, see: checkupdates-aur --help

To show orphans on STDERR:

    # checkupdates-aur --orphans

To read from output:

    # pacman -Qm | checkupdates-aur -

    note: `-` is shortcut to `-s stdin`

    `-F`: `columns`:
        `-f`: `name=?`, `ver=?`

To read from output as argument:

    # checkupdates-aur -s output -a "$(pacman -Qm)"

    `-a` - output
    `-F`: `columns`:
        `-f`: `name=?`, `ver=?`

Or if you have local repo with packages from AUR:

    # checkupdates -a '-Sl' -a my_own_repo -f name=1 -f ver=2

    `-a` - as in `-s pacman` which is default
    `-F`: `columns`:
        `-f`: `name=?`, `ver=?`

To read from filenames in folders:

    # checkupdates-aur -s files -a /path/to/repo/content/dir

    `-f`: `regexp=?`, `recursive=?` and `follow_symlinks=?`

To run in debug mode:

    # CHECKUPDATES_DEBUG=1 checkupdates-aur

Debug mode require Smart::Comments
